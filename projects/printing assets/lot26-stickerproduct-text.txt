My Role
I was the print production artist at a home decor startup, Lot 26 Studio, in San Francisco, that decided to get in on the wall sticker products trending at the time. I helped create wall sticker collections and product sales sheets to present to big box stores. I prepared artwork for printing overseas and tested prototypes in-house. 

Description
There were two brands, ADD-HERES and Adorn. ADD-HERES was peel and stick stickers and Adorn was vinyl decals that can be burnished, pressing and smoothing the sticker onto the wall surface to ensure it applies properly and removes any air bubbles or creases. The art director handpicked the color palettes and chose out artwork from stock photos and vector graphics.

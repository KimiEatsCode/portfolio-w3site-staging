  <p class="intro">I view my work experience as a 360 degree journey. This is why I coded and designed my portfolio to present all my experience in a timeline format marked by the mediums I was working at the time which I would then continue to have in my skill toolkit as I progressed in my career. To present only experience from the last 3 years would be like looking at a panoramic landscape through a small keyhole. You'd only get a glimpse, missing the full scope and the way every element connect making the person I am today.</p>

<p class="intro">Having earned my Bachelors and Masters in Media studies, as a media professional I evolved my media skills to keep up with the changing tech and social landscape of the time.</p>

  <p class="intro">I have the unique advantage to bring all my mastered skills together - print and layout design, web dev and web design, digital marketing, graphic design and user experience design - to now most prepared to come up with ideas with the combination of generative AI tools and established professional methods.</p>

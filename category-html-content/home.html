  <p class="intro">I view my work experience as a 360 degree journey with phases where I focused on different mediums including - print and layout design, web dev and web design, digital marketing, graphic design and user experience design - while having a strong foundation in media studies education. I coded and designed my portfolio to present all my experience in a photo album-like format where you can navigate through each phase forward and backward, flipping through the various stages of my career.</p>

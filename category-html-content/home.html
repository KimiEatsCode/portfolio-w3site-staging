  <p class="intro">I view my work history as a 360 degree experience where I focused on different mediums over 20 years including - print and layout design, web dev and web design, digital marketing, graphic design and user experience design - brining all my experience to today to make the most of AI in design and development. I coded and designed this website to present all my experience in a photo album-like format where you can navigate through each phase forward and backward, flipping through the various stages of my career.</p>

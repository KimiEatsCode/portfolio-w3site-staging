  <p class="project-content">
   I was the graphic and print designer on a project to refresh the design of 7 foot banners for the CareerLink Centers in Philadelphia. I worked with the project coordinator to communicate with the printer and deliver the banners. I designed 2 versions to present to stakeholders. The goal was to refresh a decade old design with current programming and diverse photography.

    <p class="project-content">
  My new banner design used Adobe Stock photos that highlight modern recovery occupations from the PA CareerLink Recovery Occupations list. A Recovery Occupation is a career that pays a living wage and has future growth of opportunities. I assisted with the copy for the banner to be less cluttered and outdated from the legacy design to market newer training and individual career services.

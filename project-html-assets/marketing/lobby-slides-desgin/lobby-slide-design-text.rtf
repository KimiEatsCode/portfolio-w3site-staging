\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Each month, I designed 4-6 slides for the lobby based on topics given to me by the Director of Communications. I used design programs including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Canva to create, edit and discuss slide designs. I used canva and hand brake to convert the design files into a video format. The lobby slides were seen by staff, board members, and government guests including the U.S. Secretary of Labor and board members from Comcast. }

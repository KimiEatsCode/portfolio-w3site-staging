I collaborated with another designer to create ideas for new brand elements. The designer worked remotely and was a contractor. I used the collaborative tools of Canva so we could contribute asynchronously. I scheduled virtual design meetings to brainstorm ideas, share design inspiration, and confirm out final design deliverables. I created a final power point presentation to sum up our work for approval from stakeholders.
